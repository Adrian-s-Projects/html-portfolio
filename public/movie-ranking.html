<h1>The Best Movies According to Adrian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>This is the most annoying movie that's why I love it! It is shown on TV in many countries every year at Christmas time!</p>
<h3>Pokemon - Old version</h3>
<p>Pokemon it's my favorite anime. Compared to the new version, the 1st one is definitely better and shows a more "Real" story.</p>
<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>"Die Hart" is the best movie ever. All series from the 1st to the last movie are amazing! Bruce Willis is the best actor I ever seen. </p>
